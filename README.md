## Revolutionary API development on Symfony

#### What is Craft

Craft is an architecture,   
a software design philosophy,    
a bundle which cuts away all the complexity and let's you focus on your API development. 

#### Is this for me

If you like Simplicity, Standardization, [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns),
[Decoupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling), [Black Box Abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box)   
then you are in the right place.   
Compared to other architectures and common development practices, Craft's priority is to avoid framework coupling, 
encourage modularity and to achieve *Conceptual Compression* of the elements required to ship a professional API.

#### What's the status

Current status is Beta/ish; work still needs to be done in the following spots:   
- documentation
- code generators 

#### Installation

`composer require atompulse/craft`


## Main Components && Concerns

### Security
Paseto based authentication with robust system for authorization.  

### Http
HTTP request/response standardization for modern API development 

### Data
Data structure definitions and pragmatic data handling utilities 

## Messaging
Standardized service oriented messaging components

## CraftBundle
Everything packed in a nice Symfony Bundle, ready to be configured and used to eliminate common boiler plate associated with
bootstraping new projects.
